# Convention Card / System Notes Structure

**Convention cards** are the means by which bridge players inform their opponents of their agreements. Usually they are printed on a single sheet of paper in a format standardized by the national bridge organization (NBO) that is sanctioning the event.

**Systems notes** can be far more detailed that a convention card, and are used by bridge partners to document their agreements. They may include expanded notes on conventions, which in turn may include sample (or complete) sets of bidding sequences that elucidate the convention.

We propose a standardized structure that can accommodate both. A partnership can record their system notes, and from that structure, output a convention card in whichever format is desired.

In addition, it is desirable to create a library of conventions, available privately or publicly, that could be added to a player's system notes.

## Platforms

A stand-alone platform could serve as a general repository for system notes and conventions, as well as the authoritative source of valid formats. Users could create system notes files and share with others with specified permissions.

The platform could also host a library of conventions. The author of a convention entry could provide a detailed explanation and links to external sources. Users could incorporate a convention by reference, or clone the convention for further modification. The original author of the convention writeup may choose to have their name and links retained in any clones. [Much more thought is needed on how this should work. It is envisioned that common conventions may have many entries, so a convention name could appear as `Beginner Stayman [by Jane Doe]`]

Other platforms could connect to the stand-alone platform to permit users to specify a convention card for an online game.

Teachers and web site authors could promote their conventions within the stand-alone platform, which would in turn link to the teacher/author website. Teachers could also create a series of convention cards that would be used progressively over a series of lessons.

Other website feature possibilities include comparing cards and conducting a partnership interview to develop a new card.

Online platforms utilizing the format could provide auto-alerts and/or bidding explanations for sufficiently described conventions.

## Format Requirements

Two formats are needed:

- one to define the fields and requirements for convention cards by a given NBO. For example, and EBU convention card may require the pair to specify if their 1NT opening may include a singleton, whereas an ACBL convention card may not.

- another to define the content of the system notes.

For example, Ann from America might have a file for her system notes that conforms to ACBL requirements. Her editor program will inform her if she is missing information required by ACBL convention cards. When she plays in a UK game, her editor can print in the EBU format, and prompt her to add any additional required fields.

## A Note on Suit Symbols

Suit symbols may be specified using the ! format, e.g. !c will render as the club symbol when displayed. Suit symbols will be parsed in field content, field labels, and option labels, including labels parsed from ids (e.g., a field id could be `2!c_opening`.

## Convention Card Structure Format

These specifications will use YAML to define formats, although of course a consumer of the file could convert to whatever is needed.

At a minimum, a structure must define its usage, version, and sections of content by category. Only one category will be required, named _general_. The general category must include a title field. So the minimum structure is:

    ---
    format: <format name>
    version: <version number>
    sections:
      general:
      fields:
        - id: title
          required: true

Each section is composed of fields and optionally an array of conventions. Including the conventions array implies that conventions may be added to that section. It is recommended to specify a `notes` field for each section. For example:

    ---
    format: ACBL_CC
    version: 0.1
    sections:
      general:
        fields:
          - id: title
            required: true
          - id: notes
            type: textarea
      other_conventional_calls:
        fields:
          - id: notes
            type: textarea
        conventions: []

Fields must include an id, which must be unique within the section. Additional attributes may be included.

A standardized set of section names needs to be developed. These could include (adapted from ACBL style card):

- `general`
- `no_trump_openings`
- `major_openings`
- `two_level_openings`
- `other_conventional_calls`
- `preempts`
- `special_doubles`
- `simple_overcalls`
- `no_trump_overcalls`
- `defense_against_no_trump`
- `over_opponent_takeout_double`
- `over_opponent_preempt`
- `direct_cue_bids`
- `slam_conventions`
- `leads`
- `defensive_carding`

## System Notes Format

A system notes file will reference the card structure to be used to define its fields. Although the card structure can have nested fields, the system notes file does not. Because field names are unique within each section, the nesting is not required to interpret the card.

In addition to the field values delineated by the card structure, any section with a `conventions` field will permit the player to define a list of conventions applicable to that section.

At a minimum, a system notes file would be:

    format: <format name>
    version: <version number>
    sections:
      general:
        fields:
          title: <text>

## Convention Format

A convention must have a title. Beyond that, additional description may be provided, along with a series of bidding sequences that apply to the convention.
